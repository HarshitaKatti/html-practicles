    <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves two main parts: **front-end development**, which focuses on the look, design, and user experience of a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and **back-end development**, which handles the server, database, and logic that power the site. Web development brings together design, coding, and problem-solving to build everything from simple webpages to complex online platforms we use every day.
